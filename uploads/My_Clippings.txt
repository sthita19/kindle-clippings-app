For top performers, a great workplace isn’t about a lavish office, a beautiful gym, or a free sushi lunch. It’s about the joy of being surrounded by people who are both talented and collaborative. People who can help you be better. When every member is excellent, performance spirals upward as employees learn from and motivate one another.

Contrary to what many people believe, dopamine is not a pleasure chemical. Simply because an event triggers the release of dopamine doesn’t mean it is something we like or get pleasure from. In fact, when you pay close attention, you’ll notice that as soon as you obtain the expected reward, you’ll often feel empty and unfulfilled.

Studies have shown that one of the best predictors of success is the ability to think long term.

By receiving constant feedback, whether through likes, comments, or immediate replies to our messages, we condition ourselves to expect fast results with everything we do. And this feeling is certainly reinforced through ads for schemes to help us “get rich quick”, and through cognitive biases (i.e., we only hear about the richest and most successful YouTubers, not about the ones who fail).

Trick #1—returning to work is easy The first trick your mind will play on you is to pretend that returning to work will be easy. It will try to convince you that you can start work whenever you choose, that you’re in control of your actions. But this couldn’t be further from the truth. In most cases, you won’t be able to get back to work for hours. You might even find yourself postponing your key tasks until the next day.

Tell yourself, “If I just spend 10 minutes on this project, I can do something else.” Most of the time, if you let yourself spend just 10 minutes, you will get “into” the project or task and 10 minutes will become an hour or however long it takes to make progress on this task or project.

Tell yourself, “If I just spend 10 minutes on this project, I can do something else.” Most of the time, if you let yourself spend just 10 minutes, you will get “into” the project or task and 10 minutes will become an hour or however long it takes to make progress on this task or project. Delegate. Maybe you are reluctant to start a project because you should not be doing it in the first place. It is not making the most of your best

A way to work around that fear of boredom, as long as you avoid the doing-too-much-at-once trap, is to have at least one task or project lined up that you will do when this commitment is completed.

When something is a have-to it’s a burden, it’s cumbersome, and, at best, you meet the minimum standards; however, the realization that you ultimately have choice creates a very different scenario. When you choose to do something, you are able to tap your resources and give your best. It is a much more empowering stance. Ultimately, you choose your actions, your results, your consequences.
